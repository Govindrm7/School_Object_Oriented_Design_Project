# School Class Project

This project is a part of an assignment that involves creating a School class with two lists of students, implementing various methods, and performing sorting based on different criteria. The project also includes reading data from CSV files and creating an inner class for student details.

## Project Requirements
- Create a `School` class with the following:
  - Two lists: `studentRoster` (using Student API) and `personRoster` (using Person API)
  - Methods to add students to each list
  - Methods to sort students in each list
  - Override `toString()` to display both lists

- Add 5 students to each list
  - `Person` as the superclass
  - `Student` as the derived subclass of Person

- Sort each list of students 4 times:
  1. By ID and display both lists
  2. By Age and display both lists
  3. By Last Name and display both lists
  4. By GPA and display both lists

- Read student data from CSV files
- Create an inner class for student parents' details
- Sort all student details based on:
  1. By ID and display both lists
  2. By Age and display both lists
  3. By Last Name and display both lists
  4. By GPA and display both lists

## Additional Instructions
- The studentRoster and personRoster should not have static data added through their objects; instead, the data should be taken from CSV files.
- Create an inner class for the student class and store the parents' details in them. The parents' details should also be taken from the CSV file.
